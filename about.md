##About the Site
This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built using Jekyll. For a while, I was attempting to use Wordpress, but too many things prevented me from liking the platform. The learning curve was large for a first time web developer, backups required more effort than I liked, and there was a lack of good free hosting services. GitHub Pages ticks all those boxes, so it's currently the platform I'm using.
